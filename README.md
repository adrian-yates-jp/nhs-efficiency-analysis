#NHS Primary Care Efficiency: Demand, Utilisation, and Attendance Behaviour

This project analyses NHS primary care appointment data from January 2020 to June 2022, using three datasets covering appointment volumes, service characteristics, and attendance outcomes. Conducted as part of the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator, the analysis translates the broad operational challenge of improving NHS efficiency and resilience into a set of focused analytical questions around demand, capacity, service design, and attendance behaviour.

The aim is to understand how primary care resources are used in practice, where inefficiencies arise, and which factors may support improved access and patient outcomes.

##Analytical Approach

The analysis examines the date through four lenses:
 • Volume and utilisation: trends in appointment volumes and estimated capacity over time
 • Service characteristics: patterns across healthcare professional types, appointment modes, and service settings
 • Attendance behaviour: analysis of “Did Not Attend” (DNA) outcomes, regional variation, and booking lead times
 • External signals: exploratory analysis of Twitter (X) data to assess its potential value


###Key Insights
 • Primary care services operated close to estimated capacity throughout much of the period, with utilisation largely driven by seasonal patterns and COVID-related disruption.
 • Appointment demand peaks in late autumn and early spring, with lower activity during summer and holiday periods.
 • General Practice accounts for most activity, but other practice staff collectively deliver a substantial share of appointments, highlighting the role of multidisciplinary teams.
 • Face-to-face and telephone consultations remain the dominant modes of delivery, with limited uptake of digital appointments.
 • Most appointments are attended, but DNAs remain significant due to the scale of activity and show meaningful regional variation.
 • Longer booking-to-appointment intervals are associated with higher DNA rates, suggesting shorter lead times support attendance.
 • Data quality issues, particularly around unmapped service settings, affect the completeness of reporting.
 • Social media analysis provides limited insight into attendance behaviour but highlights public interest in healthcare innovation and technology.

###Recommendations
 • Continue monitoring utilisation and attendance metrics to identify emerging pressure points.
 • Investigate regional variation in DNA rates to better understand local drivers of non-attendance.
 • Strengthen patient engagement and reminder systems, particularly for longer-lead appointments.
 • Improve data completeness and consistency to enhance reporting accuracy.
